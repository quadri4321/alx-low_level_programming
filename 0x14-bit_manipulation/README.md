* Prototype: int set_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index);

### Task 4: 4-clear_bit.c
Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
* Prototype: int clear_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index);

### Task 5: 5-flip_bits.c
Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
* Prototype: unsigned int flip_bits(unsigned long int n, unsigned long int m);

### Task 6: 100-get_endianness.c
